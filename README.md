# Plant explorer
Plant explorer is a simple Android application that utilize ML to regonize plants. I started this application as a weekend experiment, let's see where it ends :)

### Library usage
Plant explorer makes use of the following libraries
* [CameraX](https://developer.android.com/training/camerax) - To handle all camera-related operations
* [ML Kit](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit) - mobile SDK for on-device machine learning
* [aiy/vision/classifier/plants_V2](https://tfhub.dev/google/lite-model/aiy/vision/classifier/plants_V1/2) - TensorFlow lite model to classify plants

### Contribution
